# What is a Set in Python?
A set is an unordered, mutable collection of unique elements. It is mainly used to store items without duplicates, and to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
Key Features:
Unordered: No index; elements don't have a fixed position.
Mutable: You can add or remove items.
No duplicates allowed: Repeated values are automatically removed.
Can contain only immutable items (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
