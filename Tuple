# What is Tuple in Python:
A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed (they are immutable) after they are created.
Key Features of Tuples:
Ordered: Elements have a defined order and can be accessed by index.
Immutable: You cannot add, remove, or change elements after creation.
Can contain mixed data types: Integers, strings, lists, other tuples, etc.
Allow duplicates: The same value can appear more than once.
